Philosophy Meets Technology
I sometimes find myself daydreaming about how philosophical concepts could transform AI technology and perhaps even the ground of reality itself. While these thoughts can get abstract, they fuel my practical explorations of knowledge systems.
Philosophy isn't just theoreticalâ€”it provides frameworks for organizing information and making decisions that have practical applications in our digital tools. The way we structure our notes, automate our workflows, and design our systems all reflect underlying philosophical assumptions about what matters and how information should flow.
