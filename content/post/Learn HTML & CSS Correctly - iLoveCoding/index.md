## What is HTML?

HTML abbreviation for **H**yper **T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage, is a Markup Language to put together the¬†structure of a web page. Think of HTML as the skeleton of a webpage. There is no website or webpage on the internet that does not use HTML. Without HTML, the web would not be possible.

### What HTML is not

HTML is not a programming language. Please don't confuse the two concepts. A programming language has logical and computational capability to instruct a computer to do some operations. A markup language, on the other hand, is static and is only used to organize data in a specific structure. HTML in our case is used to give structure to a web page.

## What is CSS?

CSS stands for **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets. Think of it as the skin and clothing for the HTML webpage. CSS is simply a list of style properties that get applied to HTML elements. Just the way clothing is put onto a human body, similarly, CSS styling is applied on HTML elements. CSS enhances the colors, layout, and styling of the HTML webpage, making it look more beautiful and professional.

## Why learn HTML and CSS?

Unlike programming languages, HTML and CSS have NO competition. If you want to make web pages, start a career in web design, web development or even web journalism, the basic knowledge of HTML and CSS is a must have.

Fortunately, the foundation of HTML and CSS are not that difficult. You can start getting comfortable with HTML in a matter of hours. Basic CSS is also not that difficult, however, CSS can get complicated when trying to build advanced layouts.

This course, ["Learn HTML and CSS Correctly"](https://ilovecoding.org/courses/htmlcss2), will hold your hand to teaching you the basics and advanced concepts of HTML and CSS, so you are comfortable building simple and advanced websites.

## What can you build with HTML and CSS?

Any website layout! Yes, any. All, yes all websites use HTML and CSS, and once you get a hang of it, you can build websites as beautiful as Airbnb, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon (You name it).

Remember one thing! HTML and CSS will only help you build website layouts and static websites. The intelligent aspect of a webpage, such as a login capability, storing information in a database and advanced interactivity is built with a programming language such as JavaScript. Once you are comfortable with HTML and CSS¬†and have built some projects, your next step is to [learn JavaScript](https://ilovecoding.org/courses/js2)

## What resources should you refer when learning HTML and CSS

Take this course as you guide! For reference, I highly recommend the [HTML reference on Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference). They also have some really [good guides here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML).

Web Docs on Mozilla (MDN) is the most authentic and trusted source to lookup information on web technology - HTML, CSS and, JavaScript. Whenever I need more information on a topic, I google the following query *"topic name mozilla"*
